# data_meters

This folder contains the raw `.xlsx` files from each meter. There should be 39 overall. These files are not tracked by git.

To populate this folder on your own computer for testing, copy in all the `.xlsx` files from e.g. the `Downloads for CCI CC_2H22` folder.

(For some reason the `Downloads for CCI CC_1H22` folder has a couple of meter files missing.)
